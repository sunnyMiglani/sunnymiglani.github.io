  I'm interested in plants, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sunnymig"> music </a> and really bad puns. In tech, I'm interested in scalable systems and cloud technologies.  I enjoy focusing on customer impactful work, with a special interest and admiration for applying HCI principles when designing systems.
